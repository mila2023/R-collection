# Weather vs Crop Growth (Poland)

## Overview
This repository hosts a small group project exploring how weather (temperature, precipitation, soil wetness, etc.) relates to the growth/performance of strawberries, potatoes and corn across different areas of Poland, in selected months and years. 
The work is primarily an exploratory data analysis + visualization project — we compared weather variables with growth indicators and produced a final presentation summarizing our findings.

## What’s in this repo
The files are stored in one combined folder — we did not split them into rigid subfolders. You’ll find a mixed collection of:

*.csv — raw / processed data tables

*.R — R scripts (analysis, plotting)

*.RData / workspace files — two saved workspaces

*.jpeg — figures / graphs

Final_presentation.pptx — our final presentation (summary of the project)

If you want to understand what we did quickly, open the final presentation first — it contains the project summary, key charts, and references to the data and scripts used.
